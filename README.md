1. **Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**

The client was The Gaming Room and they wanted to expand their game called Draw it or lose it from mobile to other platforms.

2. **What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**

I evaluated necessary approaches and requirements to help the client on choose targets and approaches. Such as if they want to use cloud service or run traditional servers infrastructure.

3. **What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**

Domain model part helped me develop the code most. Thanks to diagram on classes and which are connected and inheriting from another, it helped me visualize how the software will work.

4. **If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

I would revise Design Constraints. I felt like I wasn't thinking about the big picture on what could be the constraints when expanding this game to other platforms. I would think about other platforms and how to bring the code from mobile and make it work on other consoles and platforms.

5. **How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

User's goal and needs matter the most when developing project. And if you don't fully understand what user wants, you could build wrong software, tools and waste user's budget and time. This is similar to swing on a tree. A swing has to be functional for chidlren to play but if adult builds swing wrong, children can't play on it.

6. **How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**

First, I wanted to grasp full understanding of how the software will be and what the user wants to do with it. Client desires also can change mid way such as requirements and features. So I will also keep sections seperate and update them as client changes their minds or wants to add new feature.
